The project is a restaurant directory web application built in Laravel using Blade and MySQL. The system must include three distinct user roles with different access levels and capabilities:

---

1. **Regular User**
   - Can browse public restaurants.
   - Can view details of restaurants (only if they are approved).
   - Can leave reviews (including rating and comment).
   - Reviews must be paginated or lazy-loaded.

2. **Owner**
   - Has all the permissions of a regular user.
   - Can create and edit their own restaurants.
   - When a restaurant is created or edited, it must be sent for admin review.
   - Admin must approve or reject it. In case of rejection, a reason (message) must be added, and the owner will be able to edit and resubmit it.
   - Can submit a suspension request for their restaurant (for maintenance or temporary closures), but it must be approved by the admin.

3. **Administrator**
   - Has full system control.
   - Can delete or block any user (regular or owner).
   - Can approve or reject new or updated restaurants.
     - Rejection requires a written reason that the owner will see.
   - Can directly suspend or delete any restaurant without approval.
   - Can edit any restaurant if needed.
   - Must review suspension requests from owners and approve/reject them.

Additional requirements:

- Each restaurant should have a status managed via a **dedicated Enum** or constant (e.g., pending, approved, rejected, suspended).
- The system should send notifications (via **Laravel Notifications**) to admins or owners when:
  - A restaurant is submitted for review.
  - A restaurant is approved or rejected.
  - A suspension is approved/rejected.
- Use **Policies or Middleware** to enforce role-based access.
- Implement **lazy loading or pagination** for reviews to avoid performance issues.
- Include seeders and factories to support development/testing.
- Structure the project so that it is scalable and modular for future features like table reservations or payments.
- Apply soft deletes where needed (e.g., for restaurants and users).

Please suggest and implement any improvements that increase security, performance, maintainability, or user experience. Design the system like itâ€™s for production from day one.
